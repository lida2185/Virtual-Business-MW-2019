In order to make changes to your website, you need to change the code such as >, #, *, etc.

There are a few markdown syntax to keep in mind:

1. **Heading**: 

- To create a heading or a list of headings, you need to use # then type your heading.

For example:

# H1

2. **Bold**:

- So as to generate a bold, you will need to put the text between the 2 asterisks and then close it with 2 asterisks.

Take a look at this:
- ** text ** & remember no space between the asterisks and the text so it'll look like this:
**text**

3. **Italic**:

- In order to italize your text, put 1 asterisk and then type your text then close it with 1 asterisk.

To illustrate:
*text* & again no spaces between them

4. **Blockquote**:
- For blockquote, just put a bigger than sign > before the text.
>hi, how are ya?
